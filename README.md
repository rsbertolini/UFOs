## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a web page using html that would accept 5 different field inputs from a user.  A JavaScript listener
would be monitoring for changes to those fields and send the new inputs to functions written in the JavaScript code that would update the table. 
As more filter inputs are received the table data is filtered to a greater degree.


## Results
To perform a search, you can filter on as few or as many fields as you like.  Entering data in 1 field will immediately prompt the listener
to send the newly changed data to the updateFilter function and rebuild the table.

You can further refine your search by querying for more fields.  As you send more filter criteria, your data will become more refined.
